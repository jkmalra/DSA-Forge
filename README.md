This repository is my personal forge — where I train daily on Data Structures & Algorithms, practice logical thinking, and refine patterns for problem solving in **Python** (primary) and **Java** (secondary).

## Goals
- Solve **at least 1 problem daily** (no skip days).  
- Reach **200+ problems by Dec 2025** (mainly Easy + Medium).  
- Focus on **reusable patterns**, not rote memorization.  
- Build confidence to explain *every line of my code* logically.  
- Practice clean, structured problem-solving flow.
