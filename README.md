# DSA - Forge repository

This repository contains my daily practice of Data Structures & Algorithms.
I am focusing on mastering **patterns** (arrays, strings, hashing, recursion, DP) and writing clean solutions in **Python**.  

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- **problems/** â†’ All solved problems, organized by difficulty (`easy/`, `medium/`, `hard/`).
- **patterns/** â†’ Common DSA patterns (sliding window, binary search, DP, etc.).
- **CheatSheets/** â†’ Quick reference notes.
- **Progress/** â†’ Daily log of problems solved
- **utils/** â†’ Helper templates.

## ðŸ› Language
- Python (primary)
- Java (secondary)

## Goals
- Solve at least 1 problem daily.
- Cover 200+ problems by Dec 2025 (Easy + Medium mix).
- Focus on reusable **patterns** instead of rote solutions.

## Progress
Check [progress.md](./progress.md) for my daily/weekly problem-solving log.
